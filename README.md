# Gitmemoji

Gitmemoji is a web-based [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) quiz game. It is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## 🏗️ Local Development

### 🐙 Git Flow

Gitmemoji uses [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for its branching model. The `main` branch is the default branch and contains the latest stable release. The `develop` branch contains the latest development version.

We're using `git-flow` to manage our branches. You can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS:
